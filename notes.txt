SOME NOTES CONTENT TO ADD TO SITE

cooperatives are often 
present where private or state service providers are unable or unwilling to go.

Cooperatives thus play a key role in health and social care, access to financial 
services as well as water and energy provision in rural areas in many countries.

agricultural cooperatives help farmers access the inputs required to grow 
crops and keep livestock and help them process, transport and market their products.

Third, cooperatives are contributing towards gender equality by expanding womenâ€™s opportunities to participate in local economies.
